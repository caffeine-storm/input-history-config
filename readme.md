goal: have a widget that shows "how" I'm typing
	- answers questions like "what movement command was that in vim?"
	- persists long enough for seqs to be grokked


todo:
- bouncing 'j/k' should just flash the existing 'j' and 'k' elements
- 'shift+5' should be '%'
- bug: spam >> wait for clear >> input-is-ignored >> spam >> input-is-recognized
