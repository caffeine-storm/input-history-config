goal: have a widget that shows "how" I'm typing
	- answers questions like "what movement command was that in vim?"
	- persists long enough for seqs to be grokked


todo:
- bouncing 'j/k' should just flash the existing 'j' and 'k' elements
- 'shift+5' should be '%'
- have only one line of display; have a max width and drop overflowed strokes
